# elijah-furman-itineraries
A collaboration between the University of Haifa and the Elijah Lab and the Department of Classics at Furman University.

This collaboration is part of the "New Classics Workshop Series" sponsored by the Furman Humanities Center, with the goal of applying and implementing the methods of "Digital Philology" developed in traditional Classics to a variety of other sources and languages, modern and premodern. This is our first workshop series, and it focuses on the application of translation alignment in digital environments to a corpus of historical itineraries in Hebrew, with translations in English and Arabic. 

In the course of a series of preliminary meetings, we confronted the needs and issues of editing geographical texts in Hebrew and their translations, with the main goal of finding a suitable environment for aligning references to placenames across languages. 

After a series of tranformations, in the final meeting we will illustrate the use of DUCAT ([Daughter of Ugarit Citation Alignment tool](https://github.com/Eumaeus/ducat)) to perform manual translation alignment across multilingual texts, and we will see how placenames in different languages can be matched and exported for further manipulation.
