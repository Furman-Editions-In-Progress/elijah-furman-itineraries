         This is the book of travels, which was compiled by <persName xml:id="recogito-086c8115-7e43-4f3f-ae4d-549dfc0f5410">Rabbi Benjamin</persName>, the
         son of <persName xml:id="recogito-b100b332-712d-42ff-95b3-33d9de17339c">Jonah</persName>, of the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-0bce778c-e196-4694-8130-988d0d725d35">Navarre</placeName>--his repose be in Paradise.
         The said <persName xml:id="recogito-59cd30b2-103c-42de-89dd-8d73c2ee61b5">Rabbi Benjamin</persName> set forth from <placeName xml:id="recogito-c53868dc-832a-4aa4-87dd-ca36406fb685">Tudela</placeName>, his native city, and
         passed through many remote countries, as is related in his book. In
         every place which he entered, he made a record of all that he saw, or
         was told of by trustworthy persons--matters not previously heard of in
         the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-f67aebdb-5956-42da-91b0-4ba055b46aea">Sepharad</placeName>[1]. Also he mentions some of the sages and
         illustrious men residing in each place. He brought this book with him
         on his return to the country of <placeName xml:id="recogito-099d13ee-1299-4a5c-b2f7-f21a24b455d0">Castile</placeName>, in the year 4933 (C.E.
         1173)[2]. The said <persName xml:id="recogito-992314b8-8925-4bb6-b5f0-b4d8f1a99025">Rabbi Benjamin</persName> is a wise and understanding man,
         learned in the Law and the Halacha, and wherever we have tested his
         statements we have found them accurate, true to fact and consistent;
         for he is a trustworthy man.
